/*
c_cpp_properties.json configures the Visual Studio Code C/C++ extension to provide optimal IntelliSense, code navigation 
and editing support for each workspace and project. It controls the compiler, includes, defines, and language standards.
The settings apply only within VS Code, not to the actual build. The file can be shared across team members working on a project.
